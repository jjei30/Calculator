# Calculator
A simple Java calculator

## Functionalities
*Add, sub, multiply, divide, and mod
*Clear the answer screen
*Delete what's in the answer screen one by one

## Problems to be fixed
*When choosing another operand after it is already done, it will instead focus on the last two operand. For example 5+5+3+2 it will only look at 3+2
*When the answer is shown the user has to press AC to clear out the answer screen
*Maybe more operands?
